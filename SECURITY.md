# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of SolarTunes with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SolarTunes seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately

Send your vulnerability report to: **security@solartunes.dev** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity (see below)

## Vulnerability Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure of sensitive information

### High (Fix within 1 week)
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- CSRF vulnerabilities

### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable bugs with security implications

## Security Considerations for Raspberry Pi Deployment

### Network Security
- **Default Configuration**: SolarTunes runs on port 3000 by default
- **Recommendation**: Use a firewall to restrict access to trusted networks only
- **Access Point Mode**: When using the built-in access point feature, change default passwords

### File System Security
- **Music Directory**: Ensure proper permissions on `~/Music` directory
- **Upload Feature**: File uploads are restricted to WAV files and processed through ffmpeg
- **Script Execution**: Setup scripts require sudo privileges - review before running

### Audio System Security
- **ALSA Access**: The application requires access to audio devices
- **Process Management**: Audio processes are managed through system commands
- **GPIO Access**: Motion detection requires GPIO access (if using PIR sensors)

### System Integration
- **Systemd Service**: Runs as a non-root user by default
- **Log Files**: System logs may contain sensitive information
- **Auto-start**: Service auto-starts on boot - ensure physical security of device

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update SolarTunes and system packages
2. **Network Isolation**: Run on isolated network when possible
3. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong passwords for any authentication
4. **Physical Security**: Secure physical access to Raspberry Pi
5. **Regular Backups**: Backup configuration and music files

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **File Upload Security**: Strict file type checking and processing
3. **Command Injection Prevention**: System commands use parameterized execution
4. **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies
5. **Minimal Privileges**: Application runs with minimal required privileges

## Known Security Considerations

### Audio File Processing
- **ffmpeg Usage**: Audio files are processed through ffmpeg for format conversion
- **File Validation**: Only WAV files are accepted for upload
- **Temporary Files**: Temporary files are cleaned up after processing

### Motion Detection
- **GPIO Access**: Requires GPIO access for PIR sensor functionality
- **API Endpoints**: Motion detection API endpoints are accessible without authentication
- **Process Management**: Motion detection runs as a separate service

### System Commands
- **Audio Control**: Uses system commands (aplay, amixer) for audio functionality
- **Process Management**: Uses system commands for process control
- **Log Access**: Accesses system logs through journalctl

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security vulnerability report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you on disclosure timing
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
6. **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released, we'll publish a security advisory

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2)
- Documented in release notes with severity level
- Announced through GitHub releases and security advisories
- Backported to supported versions when possible

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Email**: security@solartunes.dev
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory
- **General Issues**: Use GitHub issues for non-security bugs

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.
