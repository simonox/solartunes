## 🌱 Features

- **🎵 Sound Library**: Browse and play .wav files from your Music directory
- **🎮 Simple Controls**: Click to play/stop with single-file playback protection
- **📊 System Monitoring**: Real-time system logs for debugging
- **🌿 SolarPunk Design**: Beautiful green gradients and nature-inspired UI
- **⚡ Low Power**: Optimized for solar-powered Raspberry Pi setups
- **🔄 Auto-Start**: Systemd service for automatic startup on boot

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository


mkdir ~/solartunes
cd ~/solartunes
git clone https://github.com/simonox/solartunes.git .

### 2. Run the Setup Script

chmod +x scripts/setup-raspberry-pi.sh
./scripts/setup-raspberry-pi.sh

### 3. Deploy the Project

chmod +x scripts/deploy-project.sh
./scripts/deploy-project.sh

### 4. Start the Service

sudo systemctl start solartunes

## 🔧 What the Setup Script Does

- ✅ **System Updates**: Updates all packages to latest versions
- ✅ **Audio Setup**: Installs ALSA and audio tools (aplay, pulseaudio)
- ✅ **Node.js 20**: Installs latest LTS version via NodeSource
- ✅ **pnpm**: Installs fast, disk space efficient package manager
- ✅ **Audio Config**: Sets up audio permissions and ALSA configuration
- ✅ **Systemd Service**: Creates auto-start service for boot
- ✅ **Log Rotation**: Manages log files to prevent disk overflow
- ✅ **Test Files**: Creates sample .wav files for testing
- ✅ **Helper Scripts**: Management utilities for easy control

## 🎛️ Service Management

Use these commands to control your SolarTunes service:

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start solartunes

# Stop the service  
sudo systemctl stop solartunes

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart solartunes

# Check status
sudo systemctl status solartunes

# View real-time logs
sudo journalctl -u solartunes -f

# Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable solartunes

# Disable auto-start
sudo systemctl disable solartunes

## 🎵 Adding Your Own Sound Files

1. Copy your .wav files to the Music directory:
   cp your-sounds/*.wav ~/Music/

2. Refresh the web interface or restart the service:
   sudo systemctl restart solartunes

3. Your new files will appear in the Sound Library!

## 🌐 Access Your Sound Player

After setup, your SolarTunes player will be available at:

**Local Access:** `http://localhost:3000`

**Network Access:** `http://[your-pi-ip]:3000`

To find your Pi's IP address:
hostname -I

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status solartunes

# Check logs for errors
sudo journalctl -u solartunes -n 50

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart solartunes

### No Audio Output
# List audio devices
aplay -l

# Test audio with a file
aplay ~/Music/test-tone.wav

# Check audio groups
groups $USER

### Web Interface Not Loading
# Check if port 3000 is in use
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :3000

# Check firewall settings
sudo ufw status

# Restart networking
sudo systemctl restart networking

## 🔄 Updating SolarTunes

To update your installation:

cd ~/solartunes/
./scripts/pdate-project.sh

## Wav files that does not work

Not all wav formats are supported, you can convert them using ffmpeg:

ffmpeg -i ~/Music/Testaudio_LR_getrennt.wav -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 2 -ar 44100 fixed.wav

## ⚡ Solar Power Optimization

For solar-powered setups:

1. **Monitor Power Usage:**
   # Check system load
   htop
   
   # Monitor power consumption
   vcgencmd measure_temp
   vcgencmd get_throttled

2. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Use efficient .wav files (lower bitrates for longer playback)
   - Enable auto-shutdown during low battery
   - Schedule playback during peak solar hours

3. **Battery Management:**
   - Monitor battery voltage in system logs -> I have no idea how to do this, as we just have a usual battery.
   - Set up low-power mode triggers -> Same, we don't know how much power is in the battery.
   - Use the sensor (movement and illumination) to detect night and day, when there is no light, put the Pi in power safe mode.

4. **To Dos**
   -  upload wav files
   -  install sensor (movement and illumination)
   -   lock SD Card in read only-mode
   -   unlock SD Card for uploading
   -   move log files to RAM disk (as SD Card is locked)
